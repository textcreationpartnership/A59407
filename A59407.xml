            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> TOWER.</head>
            <p>IT was about the time when the Tavern Doors were ſhut up, and all Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals were retir'd to their Reſt, ſave the Club at the Devil, who were in a hot fit of Wine and Argument, about the Election of a new King of <hi>Poland,</hi> when the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> of the late King <hi>Tapsky</hi> came boulting through the Keyholes of my Chamber-Door.</p>
            <p>He ſeem'd like the Emblem of Envy, his Hairs turn'd into Serpents, his Tap into a Pump, ſpouting with Sulphur and corroded Poiſon, with a long Veil of Hypocriſie Ermin'd and Spotted with Blood.</p>
            <p>In this Gaſly-ſight he appear'd by my Bed-ſide, where after a ſtrong Debauch of <hi>French</hi>-Wine, and <hi>Itallian</hi>-Love, falling into a pleaſant Slumber, I began as uſually, to Dream of a Parliament, when thus the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> apply'd himſelf unto me,</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ghoſt.</speaker>
               <p>Thou Fool, thou flatters thy ſelf with the hopes of a Parliament; thou Prateſt, and Talkeſt, and Dreameſt, of Parliaments, when they will make no more for Thee, then thou haſt made for the Proteſtant Intereſt, ſince thou turn'd Hypocrite, and put on the <hi>Salamanca</hi> Robes.</p>
               <p>Aſtoniſh'd at the unexpected Spectre, in a Bloody Sweat and Panick Fear, I crept under the ſmoaking Blankets, leaſt he came to Involve me and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a new Plot, or with a Summons, to fetch me into the other World, when thus he apply'd himſelf to me.</p>
               <p>Fear not (Friend) thy time is not yet come, though thou ſcap'd the late But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocking, thou ſhalt Reign a while, though it be but ſhort, we have uſe for ſuch neceſſary Inſtruments upon Earth, to bring our Projects to Perfection.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt (Doctor) how many Jorneys thou haſt made to the Tower, when I was there, where we laid the Foundation of all our Deſigns, and 'tis but fit I ſhou'd make one Sally from Hell to give Thee thanks for the good Service thou haſt done us. The Plot was well carried on at firſt, the Jeſuits was a clever Jobb, and we will Record Thee in our Eternal Rubricks. But for the Lords in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43816:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>Tower, I am afraid, in this long Reſpeit, they will weather the point, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live our Malice; but make uſe of the Artillery I gave thee, and thou may'ſt be able yet, with thy ſtock of Impudence, to venture a Broad-ſide amongſt 'em.</p>

               <p>At this, methought, I began to aſſume freſh Courage, and finding the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was not come to fetch me that very Inſtant, I began to argue with him as formerly, and asked of him, if he were Dead, or Alive? or if Dead, where he was diſpoſed of, or what Reward he had found in the other World for all his Indefatigable Pains and Policy, when thus, (methought) with a ſhril Voice, and quivering Accent, he Anſwered,</p>

               <speaker>Ghoſt.</speaker>
               <p>From Deepeſt Manſions of Hell, where Plots are laid, and Plotters are with us to be Rewarded; I come to tell Thee, That all thy Stratagems are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, thy Villanies Detected, and thy Politicks Undermin'd; thy Artillery will be turn'd upon thy Self, blown up with the Army, which thy ſelf ſo long ago, planted under ground.

               <p>This generous Kindneſs and Correſpondence renewed even after Death, made me take compaſſion of the trembling ſhade, offering him ſhare of my Bed, which (methought) he willingly accepted, laying himſelf in ſuch a poſture as was moſt ſuitable for my preſent Fancy to work upon. He had no ſooner laid down, but imagining it had been my old Familiar, whom I had often made uſe of on that occaſion. I fell in cloſe Embraces, like <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in Combat with a Shadow, but with the violent ſtrugling I awaked, which troubled me when I found it was but a Dream.</p>
